# What I Learned

- import code from crates(packages) with `use crate::function`
- let: declares variables (immutable by default)
- mut: lets variables be mutable
- loop: basic loops that goes on until breaked; iteration can be skipped with continue
- match exp {}: pattern matching
- Result: either Ok or Err, has subtypings
- &: passes the variable reference
- variables can be typed using `name:type` syntax, although they types are usually infered from value
